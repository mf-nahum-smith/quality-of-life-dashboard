<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Arts, culture and creative expression are critical to a thriving community, contributing to education, economic development, and participation in civic life. The arts can help build community by fostering relationships, helping communities to understand and celebrate their heritage, and providing a civic space to discuss and solve difficult problems. Arts participation may be impacted by many factors including affordability, location and accessibility of venues and programs, cultural/language barriers, and availability of community outreach programs. </p>

<p>Americans for the Arts estimates that arts and culture organizations in Mecklenburg County support over 6,000 full-time equivalent jobs, and generate over $8 Million in revenue to local government. In 2014, The Arts and Science Council awarded $13.7 million in grants and program services, including $93,000 to support teachers&#39; professional development. </p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Number of households that participate in arts and culture activities and organizations sponsored by the Arts &amp; Science Council (ASC), divided by total number of households. Participation is measured by ticket purchases, memberships and donations to one or more of the 22 organizations that receive operating support grants from ASC, and/or ASC membership. </p>
<p>Participation is limited to people whose household location could be determined, e.g., provided address information or paid with a credit card and provided a billing address. Total households are calculated by multiplying the occupancy rate from the U.S. Postal Service by the number of housing units from the Mecklenburg County tax parcel database. Data are received from the Arts &amp; Science Council at the block group level and aggregated to NPAs. </p>
