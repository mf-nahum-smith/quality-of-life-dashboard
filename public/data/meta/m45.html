<p>ï»¿## Proximity to a Grocery Store
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a full-service, chain grocery store</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Healthy food and physical activity are essential for combating obesity, reducing preventable chronic diseases and promoting overall healthy living. Grocery stores can provide access to a greater variety of cheaper and healthier foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables, helping to facilitate healthier dietary choices. While they are not included here, Farmers&#39; markets provide another source of community access to fresh, locally produced fruits, vegetables and other food products, and may be particularly important in areas poorly served by full-service grocery stores. Proximity to a grocery store is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are cost, hours of operation, transportation, and geographic barriers such as major highways.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>Overall, 30% of housing units in Mecklenburg County had proximity to a chain grocery store in 2018, up from 26% in 2011. The total number of full-service, chain grocery stores in Mecklenburg County is constantly increasing - 141 in 2011 to 161 in 2018.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>In 2014, 24% of people in Mecklenburg County were medically overweight or obese, 18% experienced food insecurity over the past year, and 7% of low- and moderate-income households had limited access to healthy foods. Through community-wide action planning, the Mecklenburg County Health Department is working to improve access to healthy foods and food choices through: building community and school gardens, working to have SNAP benefits accepted at farmer&#39;s markets, attracting full-service grocery stores to food deserts and improving healthy school lunch and vending machine choices.</p>
