<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Average age of death is a measure of the quality of health and life in a community. A number of factors contribute to average age of death including economic status and educational attainment, access to quality health care, individual health behaviors, exposure to violence and crime, traffic safety conditions, and general rates of disease. Overall health and age of death may also be impacted by characteristics of the built environment such as exposure to environmental hazards, lack of access to healthy food, and few opportunities for safe physical activity. </p>
