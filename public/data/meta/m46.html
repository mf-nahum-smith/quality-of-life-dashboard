<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Pharmacists serve as an &quot;in-the-community&quot; resource for health and medication information, and may also offer acute health care clinics for basic immunizations and the treatment of minor illness. In addition, prescription drugs dispensed at pharmacies allow large numbers of people to control chronic disease and disability, improving individual and community health. Proximity to a pharmacy is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are cost and health insurance coverage, hours of operation, wait time, transportation, cultural/language barriers, and geographic barriers such as major highways. </p>
