<p>Percentage of eligible streams adopted for clean-up</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Neighborhoods, businesses, individuals and organizations can make a difference in their community by adopting a stream and committing to two clean-ups a year - walking the stream channel, picking up litter and reporting water pollution. Stream clean-up events are an effective way to improve water quality, wildlife habitat and aesthetics, and promote stormwater awareness and pollution prevention. Working together to clean up streams can also promote community building and participation in neighborhood events.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>Each year, more than 1,200 volunteers remove over 9 tons of trash from local creeks and streams. </p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>There are eleven volunteer programs relating to water quality available to residents of Mecklenburg County - you can volunteer a couple hours a year, make a long-term commitment to your neighborhood stream or groundwater aquifer, or simply take the time to report unusual stream conditions.</p>
