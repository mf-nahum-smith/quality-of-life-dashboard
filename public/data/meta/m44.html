<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Public transportation systems can provide affordable, safe and equitable access to work, home, education, food, health services, social activities and more. Public transportation usage, particularly as an alternative to driving, may also provide health benefits such as increasing physical activity, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, reduced fatalities and injuries, and greater social cohesion.  </p>
<p>Transit ridership can be impacted by a variety of factors. These factors include: bus stop location, frequency and hours of service, ridership cost, traffic congestion, fuel cost/availability, parking availability, employment rates, and more.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>According to Sustain Charlotte, transit ridership using the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) more than doubled from an average of 44,014 riders per day in 2000 to 92,134 in 2012. Even when accounting for population growth over this same period, ridership increased an average of 4% per year from 633 to 994 riders per 10,000 residents.</p>
<p>In 2015, 3.4% of commuters who live in Mecklenburg County traveled regularly by public transportation, compared to 1.1% in North Carolina and 5.1% nationally.</p>
