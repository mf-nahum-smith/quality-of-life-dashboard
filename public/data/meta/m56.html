<p>﻿## Prenatal Care
Percentage of births where mother received adequate pre-natal care</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>A lifetime of healthy outcomes begins before birth with good prenatal care. Women receiving adequate prenatal care are more likely to deliver a full-term baby at a healthy birth weight, which reduces the risk for developmental delays and long-term health problems. Access to prenatal care depends on many factors including health insurance coverage and accessibility of affordable health care providers, transportation and child care, cultural or language barriers, and availability of education and outreach programs.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>Just under 64% of all mothers in Mecklenburg County received adequate prenatal care in 2015-2016. Rates of early entry into prenatal care have been declining over the past ten years.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>Despite efforts to improve prenatal care delivery and utilization, there has not been a concurrent decline     in adverse birth outcomes locally or nationally. Efforts to improve birth outcomes must also address multiple determinants integrating social, behavioral, environmental and biological factors that shape or affect pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Number of births where prenatal care was deemed &quot;Adequate&quot; using the Kessner Index divided by all live births. </p>
<p>The Kessner Index assesses the timeliness (month prenatal care began) and the frequency of care (number of prenatal visits) at different times throughout the pregnancy. &quot;Adequate care&quot; means prenatal care began in the first trimester and the minimum number of visits for each gestational age period of the baby&#39;s growth at different points during the pregnancy was met or exceeded (Page 81, Mecklenburg County Community Health Assessment 2013, Mecklenburg County Health Department). These data are cumulative for the previous 24 months. Areas with fewer than 5 births are shown as N/A. </p>
