<p>Percentage of the population who receive Food and Nutrition Services (FNS)</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) program was established to end hunger and improve the health of low-income people by helping families purchase the food they need for a nutritionally adequate diet. Benefits are able to be redeemed at most grocery stores and many farmers markets, allowing for the purchase of nutritious food while freeing up funds for other critical needs such as housing, transportation, and health care. Identifying communities with high FNS percentages is useful for service providers and neighborhoods who want to know where low-income families are located.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>The percentage of residents receiving FNS has stayed steady from 2011 to 2016. However, with population growth, the number of county residents receiving Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) has increased by 20,000 over the same period. In 2017, however, both the percentage and number of residents receiving this assistance dropped. In fact, the total number of residents receiving FNS in 2017 was about 4,000 less than in 2011. This decline can likely be attributed to the imposition of the Able-Bodied Adult without Dependents (ABAWD) work requirement in 2016. The ABAWD rule limits individuals to 3 months of food assistance within a 36 month period unless they meet certain work requirements.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Population receiving Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) divided by total population. Areas with fewer than 5 FNS recipients have been suppressed and are shown as N/A. </p>
<p>Note: Data for this variable at the Neighborhood Profile Area level are derived using individual address-level records that must be precisely located to exact addresses. It is not uncommon to have 1% to 4% of records not able to be included due to record formatting errors or the addition and subtractions of streets and housing units.</p>
