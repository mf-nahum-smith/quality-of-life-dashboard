Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of an outdoor public recreation area</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Recreational facilities provide opportunities for physical activity and social interaction, both key components of good physical and mental health. Increased physical activity is associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cancer, stroke, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality, independent of obesity. Research suggests that people who live closer to sidewalks, parks, and gyms are more likely to exercise. In a growing region like Charlotte-Mecklenburg, protecting land set aside for outdoor recreation is important to maintaining access to recreation opportunities and the community&#39;s engagement with nature and the outdoors. </p>
