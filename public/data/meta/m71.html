<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Neighborhoods, businesses, individuals and organizations can make a difference in their community by adopting a city street and committing to three clean-ups a year - picking up litter, marking storm drains, reporting graffiti and removing illegal signs. Litter can reduce the value of real estate, deter a customer from entering a business or a new employer from locating to a community, and cause damage to water quality and wildlife. Maintaining order by picking up litter or removing graffiti can encourage others to &quot;follow the rules&quot; and may increase community safety. Working together to clean up streets can also promote community building and participation in neighborhood events.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>There was an increase of 181 miles of adopted streets from 2015 to 2017. Volunteers remove almost 1,000 bags - about 17,700 pounds - of trash each year from Charlotte streets. The most frequently littered items are cigarette butts, food remnants, and food wrappers. </p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>The presence of litter in a neighborhood decreases property values by about 7%, according to a pricing model from the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
