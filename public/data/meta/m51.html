<p>Libraries foster literacy and learning, provide an open civic space, and promote education and economic development. Mecklenburg County&#39;s library system offers books and e-books, music and videos, homework assistance, and a variety of programs and activities for all ages, from story time to writing contests to job and technology training programs. In addition, the computers, internet and printers found at the library are a critical resource for users who lack these technological resources at home.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>In fiscal year 2015, the 20 library locations in Mecklenburg County were visited over 3.2 million times and lent over 6.1 million items. The Charlotte Mecklenburg Library websites were visited more than 22 million times, and over 484,000 digital items were downloaded. In all, 1.3 million reference questions were answered, and library computers were used more than 800,000 times. </p>

<p>Note: Data for this variable at the NPA level are derived using individual address-level records that must be precisely located to exact addresses. It is not uncommon to have 1% to 4% of records not able to be included due to record formatting errors or the addition and subtractions of streets and housing units:</p>
