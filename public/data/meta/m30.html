<p>Percentage of housing units that are single-family houses</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Housing units come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The amount of single-family detached housing in an area is based on the patterns of development and demands of residents at the time of construction. </p>
<p>Neighborhoods with high percentages of single-family houses are typically lower density, as lots generally range from 0.2 acres to 0.5 acres per house. Offering a diverse mix of housing in cost, age, size, style, amenities and neighborhood settings is important to meet the needs and preferences of all residents.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>According to a survey from the National Association of Realtors, Americans are conflicted when choosing an ideal place to live, with the competing priorities of closeness/convenience and privacy. When asked to choose, 50% report a preference for a walkable community with a mix of housing and nearby amenities, and 45% prefer a conventional suburban neighborhood with only single-family houses.</p>
