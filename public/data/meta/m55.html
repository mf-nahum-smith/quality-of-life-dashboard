<p>Percentage of births where birth weight was less than 5lb 8oz</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>A baby who is carried to full-term and born at a healthy weight reduces the risk of infant mortality, later developmental and educational delays, and a number of adult health problems such as asthma, high blood pressure and Type II diabetes. Premature birth (before 37 weeks) is the most common reason for low birth weight, though some babies are simply small for gestational age (called growth-restricted). The rate of low birth weight babies varies by mother&#39;s age, race/ethnicity, and overall health.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>At 9.6% in 2011-2012 and 9.7% in 2015-2016, the percentage of babies born at a low birth weight in Mecklenburg County has remained relatively stable or dropped the past ten years, and is similar to North Carolina (9%), but higher than the United States (8.2%). African American women have the highest rate of low birth weight and premature infants, but their rate has declined as the rates for Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic women are beginning to rise.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>Conditions related to prematurity and immaturity are one of the largest contributors to infant deaths. In 2015, the infant mortality rate in Mecklenburg County was 6.3 per 1,000 live births, a decrease of 13% since 2004. However, the infant mortality rate for African American infants is 3 times that for Non-Hispanic Whites and 2.3 times that for Hispanics. </p>
