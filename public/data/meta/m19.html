<p>New and renovated commercial space is an indicator of where business investment and growth is occurring in the community. Increased commercial activity can impact neighborhoods in both positive and negative ways. The upfit and maintenance of existing buildings and the addition of new commercial structures expands the capacity of businesses to serve surrounding neighborhoods and increases employment opportunities. However, commercial construction activity may also lead to tensions due to concerns over traffic, parking, and the displacement of traditional businesses as neighborhoods change over time. </p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>Commercial construction slowed during the economic recession as did residential construction. It has since increased dramatically; in fiscal year 2018, there were 4,612 commercial building permits in Mecklenburg County, a 10% increase from 4,182 in fiscal year 2011. </p>
